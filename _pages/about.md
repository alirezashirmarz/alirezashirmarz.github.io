I have been a researcher and teacher in the university which my research and teaching interests have been focused on the **# Software Defined Networking (SDN)**, **# Distributed Systems**, and **# Machine Learning (ML)** for making the network more **intelligent** and **automated** for the future. 
**Currently,** I am a **Postdoc/Visiting Researcher** at [**UFSCar**](https://www.ufscar.br) and I am working in [**LERIS** (Laboratory of Studies in Networks, Innovation, and, Software) Lab](https://leris.dcomp.ufscar.br) and I am also a part of [**SMART NEtworks and ServiceS for 2030 (SMARTNESS) Engineering Research Center (ERC)**](https://smartness2030.tech/) where I contribute as a researcher within **Cognetive Closed Control Loops Architecture for Edge IoV Services (C3LA)** and **In Edge Network Industrial Automation (NEWTON)**

My research interests encompass, but are not limited to, **Machine Learning (ML)** and its application in Dataplane to enhance **network automation and intelligence**. I focus particularly on **Augmented Reality (AR) and Cloud Gaming (CG)** applications, aiming to improve their **Quality of Experience (QoE)**. Additionally, I have a strong interest in Queue Management and automation strategies. I am also open to exploring new and challenging topics related to advancing network automation and intelligence.
